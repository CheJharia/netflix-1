TO RUN C++ VERSION:
make a new directory called "cpp" in the netflix data folder (need ~1.5 GB space)
edit the file "data_folder.txt" to point to the netflix data folder
make all
./create_binaries
./probe_bs
./funk -i

PYTHON:
edit path variable in load_bs.py and stoch_grad_desc.py to point to the right place
run load_bs.py to load text files and write it out in binary format
run stoch_grad_desc.py to see how goddamn slow it is
