TO RUN C++ VERSION:
edit TRAINING_PATH and TRAINING_FILE global vars to point to the netflix data on your machine
g++ funk.cpp
./a.out

This will load all the text files each time, haven't bothered to write the binary data stuff yet.


PYTHON:
edit path variable in load_bs.py and stoch_grad_desc.py to point to the right place
run load_bs.py to load text files and write it out in binary format
run stoch_grad_desc.py to see how goddamn slow it is
